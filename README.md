# BabyStepsIonic
#### My first Baby steps on Ionic / Any JS Framework

##### This is a project I made back when I first started learning how to code. I went all out and uploaded it to the Google Play store, only to later take it down because I did not want to deal with a new Hybrid apps policy.

###### Please forgive me lord for the sins I may have commited!

##### Project includes:

- Firebase Log in and database use.
- SQLite for offline use.
- Notifications as the main purpose of the app.
